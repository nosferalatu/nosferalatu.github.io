                <p>Given a transform <span class="math">\(T\)</span> and a point x, we can find the transformed point with <span class="math">\(T * x\)</span>. But what if we want to smoothly interpolate <span class="math">\(T\)</span> so it moves <span class="math">\(x\)</span> along the path from its initial position to its position transformed by <span class="math">\(T\)</span>? </p>
<p>What we want to find is the point <span class="math">\(x\)</span> at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(x(t) = T(t) *&nbsp;x(0)\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(x(0)\)</span> is the point&#8217;s initial position, and <span class="math">\(T(t)\)</span> is the transform at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>. Since we have only a single transform <span class="math">\(T\)</span>, we need to find a way to interpolate it over&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>One way to accomplish this is to raise <span class="math">\(T\)</span> to the power of <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, which can be done using the exponential and logarithm of the transform. Interestingly, the logarithm of a transform can also be used to easily find the velocity of a point <span class="math">\(x\)</span> in space: the velocity vector (also called the tangent vector) is just <span class="math">\(log(T) * x\)</span>. This blog post shows the relationship between the logarithm and&nbsp;velocity.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Check out this interactive example to see how the vector field changes as you manipulate the gizmo to translate and rotate the transform. The vector field represents the velocity vector at each point in space during the&nbsp;transformation.</p>
<p>As you move the gizmo, you&#8217;ll notice a white curve that traces the path from the origin to the gizmo&#8217;s transform. Along this curve, you&#8217;ll see the interpolated transform as it travels from the origin to the gizmo. As you can see, the interpolation follows the flow of the velocity vector field. The applet&#8217;s code is using the exponential and logarithm of the transform to compute the curve, interpolated transform, and vector&nbsp;field.</p>

<p>The source code for the applet can be found <a href="../../js/DerivativeAndLogarithmOfTransforms_example.js">here</a>, which includes an implementation of closed-form log() and exp() for rigid body&nbsp;transforms.</p>
<p>Next, I&#8217;ll describe how to compute the interpolated transform and the velocity vector field you see in this&nbsp;example.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s <span class="math">\(T(t)\)</span>?</h3>
<p>We have <span class="math">\(T\)</span>, but not <span class="math">\(T(t)\)</span>, which changes with time. Assuming that multiplying two transforms represents the composition of those transforms, we can find <span class="math">\(T(t)\)</span> by&nbsp;saying</p>
<p><span class="math">\(T(0) = I\)</span> (the identity&nbsp;transform)</p>
<p><span class="math">\(T(1) =&nbsp;T\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\(T(2) = T *&nbsp;T\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\(T(3) = T * T *&nbsp;T\)</span></p>
<p>More generally, we can find <span class="math">\(T\)</span> at any time by&nbsp;saying</p>
<p><span class="math">\(T(t) = T^t\)</span>.</p>
<p>The above trick is from a blog post by Fabian Giesen <a href="https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/quaternion-differentiation/">here</a> but works for any transform that uses multiplication for&nbsp;composition.</p>
<p>Now that we know <span class="math">\(T(t) = T^t\)</span>, the original equation can be rearranged&nbsp;to</p>
<p><span class="math">\(x(t) = T^t * x(0)\)</span>.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s <span class="math">\(T^t\)</span>?</h3>
<p>To compute <span class="math">\(T^t\)</span>, we need to use the matrix exponential and matrix&nbsp;logarithm.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with two facts about a matrix&nbsp;X:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(e^{log(X)} = X\)</span>&nbsp;and</p>
<p><span class="math">\(log(X^y) = log(X) * y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Put together, we can say&nbsp;that</p>
<p><span class="math">\(T^t = e^{log(T^t)} =&nbsp;e^{log(T)*t}\)</span></p>
<p>which we can plug into the earlier equation, giving&nbsp;us</p>
<p><span class="math">\(x(t) = e^{log(T) * t} * x(0)\)</span>.</p>
<p>This says that to find the point x at time t, find the transform at time t using <span class="math">\(e^{log(T) * t}\)</span>, and use that to transform the point at its initial position (at time&nbsp;0).</p>
<h3 id="WhatsTheDerivative">What&#8217;s the&nbsp;derivative?</h3>
<p>In calculus, we learned&nbsp;that</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\dfrac{d}{dt}e^{a t} = a e^{a&nbsp;t}\)</span></p>
<p>which holds true for matrices as&nbsp;well:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\dfrac{d}{dt}e^{A t} = A e^{A&nbsp;t}\)</span></p>
<p>This relationship is explained in more detail in the section <a href="#DerivativeOfMatrixExponential">the derivative of the matrix exponential</a>.</p>
<p>We can use this property to find the derivative of our earlier equation <span class="math">\(x(t) = e^{log(T)t} x(0)\)</span> with respect to&nbsp;t:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\dfrac{d}{dt}x(t) = log(T) e^{log(T) t} x(0)\)</span>.</p>
<p>This equation states that to find the first derivative (the velocity vector, also called the tangent vector) of the point at time t, you first transform the point&#8217;s initial position <span class="math">\(x(0)\)</span> with the interpolated transform <span class="math">\(e^{log(T)t}\)</span> and then multiply it by the logarithm of the transform <span class="math">\(log(T)\)</span>. This expression follows the right-to-left convention of column vectors, so you would start with the initial position <span class="math">\(x(0)\)</span>, then apply the interpolated transform <span class="math">\(e^{log(T)t}\)</span>, and finally multiply by the logarithm <span class="math">\(log(T)\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(e^{log(T) t}\)</span> acts as an operator that maps points from their initial position to their new position at time t. The matrix exponential can be thought of as like integration. At time 0, <span class="math">\(e^{log(T) t}\)</span> is the identity matrix (<span class="math">\(e^0=I\)</span> for matrix exponentials), and at time 1.0, <span class="math">\(e^{log(T) t}\)</span> is equal to the original transform matrix T (<span class="math">\(e^{log(T)}=T\)</span>).</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s this all&nbsp;mean?</h3>
<p>If we take the equation at the end of &#8220;What&#8217;s <span class="math">\(T^t\)</span>?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="math">\(x(t) = e^{log(T) t}&nbsp;x(0)\)</span></p>
<p>and substitute that into the equation at the end of &#8220;What&#8217;s the&nbsp;derivative?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\dfrac{d}{dt}x(t) = log(T) e^{log(T) t} x(0)\)</span>,</p>
<p>then we&nbsp;have:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\dfrac{d}{dt}x(t) = log(T) x(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>This relates the derivative of a moving point to the logarithm of the transformation moving that&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>One way to think of <span class="math">\(log(T)\)</span> is as a vector field of tangent vectors for the transformation. In other words, it&#8217;s the field of first derivatives. This vector field is independent of time and shows the velocity for every point in&nbsp;space.</p>
<p>That equation is saying that if you transform any point in space by the logarithm of the transform, you will get the first derivative at that point. The first derivative is the velocity, so <span class="math">\(log(T)\)</span> defines the velocity field (the field of tangent vectors at every point in&nbsp;space). </p>
<p>As a point moves through space by the transform, it forms a curve. The tangent vector at time t is tangent to the point&#8217;s position on the curve at time&nbsp;t.</p>
<p>You can think of the logarithm of a matrix as the velocity field of the action performed by that matrix. The velocity field visualized in the interactive example above is this&nbsp;field.</p>
<p>A more informal way of looking at this is to&nbsp;say</p>
<p><span class="math">\(velocity = log(transform) *&nbsp;position\)</span></p>
<p>meaning, to understand how a point will move in time, look at the vector field of the log of the transform as a velocity field. As the point flows along that velocity field, it moves in&nbsp;time.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s the differential&nbsp;equation?</h3>
<p>We can also reformulate all of this as a differential equation. Earlier, we&nbsp;had</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\dfrac{d}{dt} x(t) = log(T)&nbsp;x(t)\)</span></p>
<p>which is a differential equation. Because <span class="math">\(log(T)\)</span> is a matrix, it is more specifically a matrix differential&nbsp;equation.</p>
<p>Scalar ordinary differential equations of the&nbsp;form</p>
<p><span class="math">\(y'(t)=ay(t)\)</span></p>
<p>have the general&nbsp;solution</p>
<p><span class="math">\(y(t)=e^{at}y(0)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, matrix differential equations of the&nbsp;form</p>
<p><span class="math">\(x'(t)=Ax(t)\)</span></p>
<p>have the general&nbsp;solution</p>
<p><span class="math">\(x(t)=e^{At}x(0)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, given our equation from&nbsp;earlier</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\dfrac{d}{dt} x(t) = log(T)&nbsp;x(t)\)</span></p>
<p>we have the&nbsp;solution</p>
<p><span class="math">\(x(t) = e^{log(T) t} x(0)\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is the same as our original equation, but we started with a differential equation and found a solution. To prove this solution is correct, just take the derivative of it, which is what we did earlier in the <a href="#WhatsTheDerivative">What&#8217;s the derivative?</a>&nbsp;section.</p>
<h3>The exponential map and logarithm&nbsp;map</h3>
<p>The exponential map is defined as the infinite&nbsp;series</p>
<div class="math">$$e^{A t} = I + A t + \frac{1}{2}(A t)^2 + \frac{1}{3!}(A t)^3 + ... = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{(At)^i}{i!}$$</div>
<p>and can be used to find the exponential of real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, matrices, and more. For example, when square matrices are plugged in to the series, the result is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_exponential">matrix exponential</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the logarithm is defined as the infinite&nbsp;series</p>
<div class="math">$$log(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{i+1} \frac{(A - I)^i}{i}$$</div>
<p>If you want to know more, search for the exponential map and logarithm map. You&#8217;ll find that these are important concepts in Lie group theory. The exponential map and logarithm map are inverses of each other. In Lie theory, the exponential map maps a tangent vector at a point p to a point on the manifold. The logarithm map does the opposite, mapping a point on the manifold back to the tangent vector at&nbsp;p.</p>
<p>When reading about Lie groups, you&#8217;ll come across many different kinds of groups. There are only a few groups that are related to transforms, though. <strong><span class="caps">SO</span>(3)</strong> is a 3D rotation matrix, <strong><span class="caps">SU</span>(2)</strong> is a quaternion, <strong><span class="caps">SE</span>(3)</strong> is a 3D rigid body transform (rotation and translation), <strong><span class="caps">SIM</span>(3)</strong> is rotation, translation, and (positive) uniform scale, and <strong><span class="caps">GL</span>(n)</strong> is an nxn&nbsp;matrix.</p>
<p>There are several options for how to practically compute the exponential and logarithm map for a matrix or other&nbsp;object:</p>
<p>1) Use a math library like Eigen or Armadillo. These have functions to compute the matrix exponential and matrix&nbsp;logarithm.</p>
<p>2) The library Sophus has code for a closed form exp/log for the groups <span class="caps">SO</span>(3), <span class="caps">SE</span>(3), and <span class="caps">SIM</span>(3). Beware that it clamps its quaternions to a 3D rotation angle in -<span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> &#8230; +<span class="math">\(\pi\)</span>&nbsp;though.</p>
<p>3) There is an excellent <span class="caps">PDF</span> at the web site of Ethan Eade <a href="https://ethaneade.com/lie.pdf">here</a> which contains the closed form equations for the groups <span class="caps">SO</span>(3), <span class="caps">SE</span>(3), and <span class="caps">SIM</span>(3).</p>
<p>4) Compute the matrix exponential and logarithm by using the infinite series definitions above, and truncating after some number of terms. In my experience, this is not robust when working with floating point numbers, as you quickly start to deal with very small and very large numbers, depending on your input&nbsp;matrix.</p>
<p>5) Compute the exponential with numerical integration. Given a starting point <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, integrating it for time t is the same thing as the exponential. There are many ways to compute numerical integration, from Euler to Runge-Kutta to adaptive&nbsp;methods.</p>
<h3>Pitfalls</h3>
<p>There are a few issues that you should be aware&nbsp;of.</p>
<h4>Pitfall&nbsp;#1</h4>
<p>The logarithm of a rotation matrix will return a 3D rotation angle in -<span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> &#8230; +<span class="math">\(\pi\)</span>. More technically, there are an infinite number of logarithms for a matrix, each corresponding to a rotation angle that is  2<span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> greater than the previous one. Generally matrix logarithm code will return the principal logarithm, which is the logarithm in -<span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> &#8230; +<span class="math">\(\pi\)</span>. This can lead to discontinuities when interpolating transforms with rotations in them, such rotations from human joints (you can move your head from looking over your left shoulder to over your right shoulder and rotate a little more than 180&nbsp;degrees).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the logarithm of a quaternion returns a 3D rotation angle in the larger range of -2<span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> &#8230; +2<span class="math">\(\pi\)</span>, which makes quaternions nicer to work&nbsp;with.</p>
<h4>Pitfall&nbsp;#2</h4>
<p>When working with logarithms, be aware that that the&nbsp;property</p>
<p><span class="math">\(log(AB) = log(A) +&nbsp;log(B)\)</span></p>
<p>is <em>only</em> true when A and B commute, which is not the case for most transforms. Real numbers always commute, though, so the property does apply to them. It&#8217;s tempting to apply the property to transforms, but it&#8217;s important to remember it only applies when A and B&nbsp;commute.</p>
<p>For example, interpolating a transform by using log(rotation) plus log(translation) will result in a straight path between the start and end transform, but the correct result is a helical, screw path that is obtained by using&nbsp;log(rotation*translation).</p>
<h4>Pitfall&nbsp;#3</h4>
<p>Related to pitfall #2, you might want to interpolate two transforms A and B&nbsp;with</p>
<p><span class="math">\(interpolate(A, B, t) = e^{(1-t)*log(A) +&nbsp;t*log(B)}\)</span></p>
<p>But be careful: this only works if A and B commute, which is not usually the case for transforms. Otherwise, this interpolation is neither shortest path nor constant&nbsp;speed.</p>
<p>Instead, interpolate the relative (also called delta) transform from A to B, like&nbsp;this:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(interpolate(A, B, t) = e^{log(B A^{-1}) t}&nbsp;A\)</span></p>
<p>However, this method only works for interpolating between two transforms and not for blending more than two&nbsp;transforms.</p>
<h3>Visualizing a matrix as a vector&nbsp;field</h3>
<p>If you are wondering how you can visualize a matrix as a vector field, an eloquent explanation is in 3Blue1Brown&#8217;s video about matrix exponentiation. This part about matrices as vector fields explains that very&nbsp;well:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O85OWBJ2ayo?start=1331" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h3 id="DerivativeOfMatrixExponential">The derivative of the matrix&nbsp;exponential</h3>
<p>Earlier we used the property <span class="math">\(\dfrac{d}{dt}e^{A t} = A e^{A t}\)</span>. It&#8217;s not obvious why this property is true, but it&#8217;s an important part of unlocking all of&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>A good reference for this derivation is in the textbook Modern Robotics. <a href="http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Modern_Robotics">A free copy of that book can be found here</a>. See equation (3.43) in that&nbsp;book.</p>
<p>The matrix exponential is defined&nbsp;as</p>
<p><span class="math">\(e^{A t} = I + A t + \frac{1}{2}(A t)^2 + \frac{1}{3!}(A t)^3 +&nbsp;...\)</span></p>
<p>What then is <span class="math">\(\dfrac{d}{dt}e^{A t}\)</span>? If we take the derivative of each term of the matrix exponential&#8217;s expanded definition, we&nbsp;have</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\dfrac{d}{dt}e^{A t} = 0 + A + A^2 t + \frac{1}{2} A^3 t^2 +&nbsp;...\)</span></p>
<p>Pull out A, and then we&nbsp;have</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\dfrac{d}{dt}e^{A t} = A*(I + A t + \frac{1}{2} (A t)^2 + ...) = A e^{A t}\)</span>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the matrix <span class="math">\(A\)</span> can go on the left or right, and it always holds true&nbsp;that</p>
<p><span class="math">\(Ae^{A t} = e^{A&nbsp;t}A\)</span></p>
<p>for any square matrix, as stated in equation (3.44) in Modern&nbsp;Robotics.</p>
