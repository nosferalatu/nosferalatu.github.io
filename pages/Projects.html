            <p>These are some things I&#8217;ve worked on over the&nbsp;years:</p>
<h3>Medium (Adobe / 2020&nbsp;)</h3>
<p>Medium was acquired by Adobe at the end of 2019: <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-accelerates-3di-efforts-through-medium-acquisition/">Adobe&nbsp;Acquisition</a></p>
<p>At Adobe, I work in the 3D&amp;Immersive group, where I&#8217;m continuing to work on Medium and developing innovative sculpting and modeling&nbsp;software.</p>

<p><img alt="test image" src="/images/oculusmedium6.jpg"></p>
<h3>Medium (Oculus / 2016&nbsp;)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.oculus.com/medium/">Oculus Medium</a> is a digital sculpting application that works with virtual reality headsets and 6DoF controllers to let you sculpt, model, paint, and create solid-feeling objects in a <span class="caps">VR</span>&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>I led the graphics team at Facebook/Oculus that developed Medium from before the initial release to the Adobe acquisition. I made core contributions to Medium&#8217;s sculpting technology, such as the <span class="caps">SDF</span> sparse data structures, the real-time stamp brushes, and the move tool, as well as the Vulkan rendering backend and Transvoxel&nbsp;renderer.</p>

<h3>Headlander (Double Fine / 2016 / Windows, <span class="caps">PS4</span>, XBox&nbsp;One)</h3>
<p>After Massive Chalice and through preproduction of Headlander, I worked as Double Fine&#8217;s technical director to update the Buddha engine. We switched to LuaJIT, replaced Scaleform with an in-house <span class="caps">UI</span> library, and revised the level editing framework to combine in-game editing with a standalone Python/C++ app. The latter used a Redis database to arbitrate changes between users to allow concurrent editing. During Headlander&#8217;s preproduction, I helped develop the post processing effects that gave Headlander its unique visual&nbsp;style.</p>

<p><img alt="test image" src="/images/headlander3.jpg"></p>
<h3>Massive Chalice (Double Fine / 2015 / Windows, XBox&nbsp;One)</h3>
<p>Massive Chalice was a Kickstarter funded game. I contributed to the graphics and systems software, particularly the Windows and XBox One support. The game shipped on XBox One at 60 Hz at 1600x900 using a deferred renderer similar to Costume Quest&nbsp;2&#8217;s. </p>

<h3>Costume Quest 2 (Double Fine / 2014 / Windows, <span class="caps">OSX</span>, Linux, <span class="caps">PS4</span>, XBox One, WiiU, <span class="caps">PS3</span>, <span class="caps">XB360</span>)</h3>
<p>Costume Quest 2 shipped simultaneously on eight platforms. Much of the engineering schedule was devoted on platform work, but we were able to add a few nice features, such as deferred rendering using tiled lighting, where the light/tile intersections were found using <a href="http://jcgt.org/published/0002/02/05/">the projection of a sphere</a>. I wrote a bit about the deferred renderer on my&nbsp;blog.</p>

<h3>My Alien Buddy (Double Fine and Japan Studios / <span class="caps">PS4</span> /&nbsp;2013)</h3>
<p>Double Fine worked with Japan Studios in Tokyo to create this augmented reality experience. We contributed one room to The Playroom, which ships with every <span class="caps">PS4</span>. This project had many challenges; it was our first experience with the <span class="caps">PS4</span>, we were using Sony&#8217;s engine, and we were working with a team many time zones away in Tokyo. The engine was particularly challenging for me as the sole programmer on the project, because although the code itself was in English, the comments were in Japanese (and I do not know Japanese). Nevertheless, in four months we developed many prototypes, made a simple level editor out of Unity which exported into Sony&#8217;s engine, integrated Lua, added some rendering features such as instancing, and developed a mass/spring simulation for the alien&#8217;s squishy&nbsp;skin.</p>

<h3>Steed (Double Fine / 2014 / Amnesia Fornight&nbsp;Prototype)</h3>
<p>I was the lead programmer on this two week project and wrote the grass simulation and rendering. This heavily used geometry instancing and noise to randomly distribute and animate the grass blades. I switched the renderer from forward rendering to a deferred system to help deal with the overdraw, and developed a dynamic heightmap that the horse would render into so that you could leave trails in the&nbsp;grass.</p>

<h3>The Cave (Double Fine / 2012 / Windows, WiiU, <span class="caps">PS3</span>, <span class="caps">XB360</span>)</h3>
<p>My primary contribution to The Cave was working on the Windows and WiiU SKUs of the&nbsp;game.</p>

<p><img alt="test image" src="/images/thecave3.png"></p>
<h3>Black Lake (Double Fine / 2012 / Amnesia Fortnight&nbsp;Prototype)</h3>
<p>For this two week Amnesia Fortnight prototype, I changed the Double Fine&#8217;s hybrid forward/deferred renderer to correctly handle diffuse and specular color (and gamma correct, at that). This allowed the player to carry a lantern which illuminated a dark forest. I also wrote a system to procedurally animate thorns winding out of the ground, although in hindsight, the time constraints of the project were too short to fully develop that&nbsp;system.</p>

<h3><span class="caps">PC</span> Ports (Brutal Legend, Stacking, Iron Brigade, Costume Quest) (Double Fine /&nbsp;2011-2012)</h3>
<p>I ported several of Double Fine&#8217;s back catalog of <span class="caps">PS3</span>/<span class="caps">XB360</span> games to Windows and Steam. I used my knowledge of those consoles to adapt the Buddha engine to <span class="caps">DX9</span> and Windows. Brutal Legend was enhanced to run at 60 Hz.&nbsp;\m/ </p>

<h3>Kinect Party (Double Fine / 2012 / <span class="caps">XB360</span>)</h3>
<p>I did a lot of optimization work to Kinect Party and a few shaders here and there. I wrote a dynamic heightmap simulation that ran on the <span class="caps">XB360</span>&#8217;s <span class="caps">GPU</span> for the Bath Tub activity. The players&#8217; positions from the Kinect would intersect with the heightmap, causing ripples and waves in the water sim. I also added instancing, which was very useful in the Castle Builder and Voxel Runner&nbsp;activities.</p>

<h3>Zombie Apocalypse (Nihilistic Software / 2009 / <span class="caps">PS3</span>, <span class="caps">XB360</span>)</h3>
<p>This game reused the Conan engine and was a lot of fun. The biggest rendering feature of this game was the blood splatter on the ground, which we made by projecting particles into a deferred decal&nbsp;buffer.</p>
<p><img alt="test image" src="/images/zombieapocalypse-1.jpg"></p>
<p><img alt="test image" src="/images/zombieapocalypse-2.jpg"></p>
<p><img alt="test image" src="/images/zombieapocalypse-3.jpg"></p>
<h3>Conan (Nihilistic Software / 2007 / <span class="caps">PS3</span>, <span class="caps">XB360</span>)</h3>
<p>Conan was Nihilistic&#8217;s first <span class="caps">PS3</span> and <span class="caps">XB360</span> game. I played a core role in the team that wrote a new <span class="caps">PS3</span>/360 renderer for Nihilistic&#8217;s engine, including a data driven shader pipeline, dynamic lighting, and an <span class="caps">SPU</span> job system. After Conan shipped, we refined the renderer to use the Cell&#8217;s <span class="caps">SPU</span>&#8217;s for a variety of work, such as deferred lighting (where the Cell would do the lighting and the <span class="caps">RSX</span> would do the shadow mapping) and geometry&nbsp;processing.</p>
<p>I added support for cheap static branches in the <span class="caps">PS3</span>&#8217;s fragment shaders by using <span class="caps">SPU</span>&#8217;s to scan the patched <span class="caps">RSX</span> microcode for branches using immediate values, pruning out blocks that the branch skipped, and replacing the branch instruction itself with a <span class="caps">NOP</span>. Although the <span class="caps">RSX</span> supported branching in fragment shaders, it was very slow, even when branching on an immediate value. This technique avoided the slow runtime branch, and was shared with Sony, who released a version of the technique in the <span class="caps">PS3</span> <span class="caps">SDK</span>.</p>

<h3>Demon Stone (Stormfront Studios / 2004 / <span class="caps">PS2</span>)</h3>
<p>Demon Stone refined the <span class="caps">PS2</span> engine developed for The Two Towers. I continued to write a lot of <span class="caps">VU1</span> code, and implemented a neat notation to pack vertex data into various formats for the <span class="caps">VIF</span>/<span class="caps">VU1</span> to unpack. I implemented compressed textures on the <span class="caps">PS2</span> for this project by separating the high frequency luminance from the low frequency color and using the <span class="caps">PS2</span>&#8217;s fast <span class="caps">GS</span> to blend them&nbsp;together.</p>
<p><img alt="test image" src="/images/demonstone0.jpg"></p>
<p><img alt="test image" src="/images/demonstone1.jpg"></p>
<p><img alt="test image" src="/images/demonstone2.jpg"></p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (Stormfront Studios / 2001 / <span class="caps">PS2</span>)</h3>
<p>Looking back, we packed a lot of game into a <span class="caps">PS2</span>. Most challenging was the Battle of Helm&#8217;s Deep at the end of the game, where up to 20 skinned characters were visible at a time, including their shadows. I was particulary happy with the shadows at the time, as they were implemented using a stencil shadow technique, even though the <span class="caps">PS2</span> had no stencil hardware (but it could blend in add/subtract modes to a single color channel, which was enough). The silhouette edges of the shadows were computed on the <span class="caps">VU0</span> which were then passed through the <span class="caps">CPU</span> to the <span class="caps">VU1</span>.</p>
<p>I wrote the <span class="caps">VU1</span> microcode that performed the world and skinned character rendering. This included variants to do six plane clipping in <span class="caps">VU1</span> code. I also wrote a high performance animation system using the <span class="caps">CPU</span> and <span class="caps">VU0</span> running in parallel. The <span class="caps">CPU</span> would fetch data for the next bone from memory, and in parallel, the <span class="caps">VU0</span> would calculate the previous bone&#8217;s&nbsp;matrices.</p>

<p><img alt="test image" src="/images/lotr2.jpg"></p>
<h3>Rendition</h3>
<p>A long time ago I worked at Rendition in their DirectX driver group. I learned a great deal about how to debug software and about how hardware&nbsp;works. </p>
<p><img alt="test image" src="/images/v2200agp_fhq.jpg"></p>
<p><img alt="test image" src="/images/verite2100.jpg"></p>
<h3>Any&nbsp;Channel</h3>
<p>My first game dev job. I moved to California and started writing games. Any Channel had their own proprietary, first person, software rendered game&nbsp;engine.</p>
